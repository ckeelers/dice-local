        <p>
          The Dice Salary Predictor was a massive initative to create a salary prediction tool to assist Tech Pros in determining their salary estimate based on
          skills, job title, location, and years of experience. Responsible for collaborating closely with UX Research, product, stakeholders, and developers, initiating user
          testing to look at validating usability and user interaction design, creating initial wireframes and prototypes, UI and iterating based on user feedback.

          This project consisted of close collaboration with UX Research, product, stakeholders, developers, and setting up user testing to validate usability.
          Participated in the data analysis of off-site interviews, working closely with UX to build wireframes and designing the UI and interaction design based on user feedback.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project involved working very closely with UX research to incorporate user feedback from user testing, interviews, and heuristic evaluations
        in order to build a responsive home page that catered to three different personas through a content-driven CMS framework. The Content Consumer, Job Seeker, and Unknown User. Based on user's interactions,
        the page alters the content to show more relevant information at the top. I defined the style guide and worked closely with Project Managers, Stakeholders,
        and Marketing, designing wireframes, prototypes, and visual design that resulted in a home page that is accessible on any platform and engaged users according to their specific needs and interests.
        A full site redesign is currently in the works.

        </ul>
        <p>
          The eFinancialCareers iOS app went through a number of iterations, user testing, stakeholder interviews, wireframes and flows before launching the final redesign. The UI
          was greatly simplified to provide a clean, simple user experience that adhered well to Apple HIG Standards while also clearly representing the eFinancialCareers brand
          and focusing on the core functionality and needs of job seekers in the Finance Industry.

        Spearheaded the planning and coordination of responsive implementation including an entire site redesign. Bootstrap was chosen as the front-end framework in an effort to expedite the process. The home page,
        store page, and grocery page, as well as the header/primary navigation are just several examples of work I developed.

        ShopAtHome.com Mobile App

      <p>
        I worked closely with iOS and Android developers to build the first mobile app for ShopAtHome.com, from the initial concept through final product on iTunes and Google Play app stores. An intimate knowledge of
        the Apple HIG and Android Design Guidelines was necessary to adhere to user-centered design patterns for both platforms. Initial concepts, wireframes, and flowmaps were created to chart the user experience
        through the app and provide a simple, clean, usable interface that was forgiving and intuitive.
