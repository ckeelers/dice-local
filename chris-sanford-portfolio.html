        This project involved working very closely with UX research to incorporate user feedback from user testing, interviews, and heuristic evaluations
        in order to build a responsive website that catered to three different personas through a content-driven CMS framework. The Content Consumer, Job Seeker, and Unknown User. Based on user's interactions,
        the page alters the content to show more relevant information at the top. I defined the style guide and worked closely with Project Managers, Stakeholders,
        and Marketing, designing wireframes, prototypes, and visual design that resulted in a website that is accessible on any platform and engaged users according to their specific needs and interests.

        <p>
          The eFinancialCareers iOS app went through a number of iterations, user testing, stakeholder interviews, wireframes and flows before launching the final redesign. The UI
          was greatly simplified to provide a clean, simple user experience that adhered well to Apple HIG Standards while also clearly representing the eFinancialCareers brand
          and focusing on the core functionality and needs of job seekers in the Finance Industry.

        They say you should only show your best, most recent work. However, I feel as though showcasing some older designs illustrates the evolution of my thinking
         as well as the impact of evolving design standards and trends. Below are some older projects, some of which may no longer look as they do today.

      <p>
        Spearheaded the planning and coordination of responsive implementation including an entire site redesign. Bootstrap was chosen as the front-end framework in an effort to expedite the process. The home page,
        store page, and grocery page, as well as the header/primary navigation are just several examples of work I developed. Technologies used included: HTML5, CSS3, Less, Sass, javascript, and jQuery.

        ShopAtHome.com - Mobile App
      </P>
      <p>
        I worked closely with iOS and Android developers to build the first mobile app for ShopAtHome.com, from the initial concept through final product on iTunes and Google Play app stores. An intimate knowledge of
        the Apple HIG and Android Design Guidelines was necessary to adhere to user-centered design patterns for both platforms. Initial concepts, wireframes, and flowmaps were created to chart the user experience
        through the app and provide a simple, clean, usable interface that was forgiving and intuitive.

        WebPsychology was a freelance client of whom I worked on many different projects for, including: e-mail design, javascript form submission work, image manipulation and campaigns for a

          This landing page was the final concept in a campaign to encourage users to join the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Coaching program. A carousel was used to capture input from users via ajax
